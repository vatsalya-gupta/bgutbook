The Empire Strikes Back (1980)

I will track here changes between releases of the book, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A change in the **major** number means an incompatible change, that is a big rewrite of the book, also known as 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. I don't know if this will ever happen, but the version number comes for free. A change in the **minor** number means that something important was added to the content, like a new section or chapter. A change in the **patch** number signals minor fixes like typos in the text or the code, rewording of sentences, and so on.

The book is not finished yet, but I thought the amount of chapters I wrote was enough to give readers useful information, so I decided to publish it. The plan is to add at least 2 more parts, one on the Unix filesystem and one on bash scripting.
